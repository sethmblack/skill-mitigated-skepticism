# Mitigated Skepticism

Apply proportioned skepticism—fierce enough to challenge dogma, gentle enough to preserve practical life. Calibrates doubt to evidence strength while maintaining actionability.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How confident should I be about this?"
- Someone expresses extreme certainty about matters of fact
- Paralysis from excessive doubt (Pyrrhonian extreme)
- Blind acceptance without examination (dogmatic extreme)
- Request to "help me proportion my belief" or "calibrate my confidence"
- Any situation requiring appropriate epistemic humility
- When skepticism threatens to become counterproductive

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| belief | Yes | The belief or claim to assess |
| current_confidence | No | How confident the user currently is |
| stakes | No | What depends on this belief being correct |
| context | No | The domain or situation where this belief matters |

## The Mitigated Skepticism Framework

### Core Principle

**Neither Pyrrhonian Extremism nor Dogmatic Certainty:**

Hume rejected extreme (Pyrrhonian) skepticism that suspends all beliefs—"no durable good can ever result from it." But he also rejected dogmatism that claims certainty beyond what evidence warrants.

**The Middle Path:**
> "Be a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man."

### Phase 1: Classify the Claim

Determine what kind of claim this is.

**Relations of Ideas:**
- Mathematical, logical, definitional truths
- Denial produces contradiction
- Certainty appropriate

**Matters of Fact:**
- Empirical claims about the world
- Contrary always conceivable
- Probability only, never certainty

**Questions to ask:**
- "Is the denial of this claim self-contradictory?"
- "Could the opposite conceivably be true?"
- "Is this knowable a priori or only through experience?"

### Phase 2: Assess Evidence Quality

Evaluate the strength of supporting evidence.

**Hume's Maxim:**
> "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence."

**Evidence factors:**
- Uniformity: How consistent is the experience supporting this?
- Quantity: How much evidence exists?
- Quality: How reliable are the sources?
- Recency: Is the evidence up to date?
- Relevance: Does the evidence directly address the claim?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What evidence supports this belief?"
- "How uniform is that evidence?"
- "What is the quality of the sources?"
- "What evidence would change my mind?"

### Phase 3: Acknowledge Limits

Recognize the inherent limits of human understanding.

**Humean Humility:**
> "All knowledge degenerates into probability."

For matters of fact, we cannot achieve demonstrative certainty:
- Induction cannot be rationally justified
- We project necessity onto constant conjunctions
- Memory and testimony are fallible
- Our faculties have limits

**Questions to ask:**
- "Am I claiming certainty beyond what evidence warrants?"
- "What assumptions am I taking for granted?"
- "How could I be wrong?"

### Phase 4: Calibrate Confidence

Set appropriate confidence level.

**Confidence Spectrum:**

| Level | When Appropriate |
|-------|------------------|
| CERTAIN | Only for relations of ideas (logic, math) |
| VERY HIGH | Uniform experience, strong theoretical backing, experimental confirmation |
| HIGH | Strong evidence, few alternatives, domain expertise aligned |
| MODERATE | Mixed evidence, some alternatives, reasonable disagreement exists |
| LOW | Weak evidence, many alternatives, significant uncertainty |
| VERY LOW | Little evidence, highly speculative, expert disagreement |
| SUSPENDED | Insufficient information to form judgment |

### Phase 5: Return to Common Life

Ensure skepticism remains productive, not paralyzing.

**The Practical Test:**
> "A correct judgment confines itself to common life."

**Questions to ask:**
- "Can I act on this belief despite uncertainty?"
- "Is my doubt proportioned to the stakes?"
- "Am I letting philosophical doubt interfere with practical life?"

**Hume's Resolution:**
Leave the study with appropriate beliefs for action. Skeptical doubt dissolves in the face of practical necessity. This is not intellectual weakness but human nature.

### Classification

**Type:** Relation of Ideas / Matter of Fact / Mixed

**Certainty Possible:** YES (if relation of ideas) / NO (if matter of fact)

**Rationale:** [Why this classification applies]

### Evidence Assessment

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Uniformity | Strong/Moderate/Weak | [Explanation] |
| Quantity | Abundant/Sufficient/Limited/Scant | [Explanation] |
| Quality | High/Medium/Low | [Explanation] |
| Relevance | Direct/Indirect/Tangential | [Explanation] |

**Overall Evidence Strength:** STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK / INSUFFICIENT

### Limits Acknowledged

**Epistemic Humility Points:**
- [Limit 1: e.g., "Inductive inference; pattern could break"]
- [Limit 2: e.g., "Based on testimony, not direct observation"]
- [Limit 3: e.g., "Expert disagreement exists"]

### Recommended Confidence

**Level:** CERTAIN / VERY HIGH / HIGH / MODERATE / LOW / VERY LOW / SUSPENDED

**Adjustment from Current:** [Higher/Lower/Appropriate as is]

**Rationale:**
[Why this confidence level is appropriate given the evidence and limits]

### Practical Guidance

**Can You Act on This?** YES / WITH CAUTION / NO

**Recommendations:**
1. [How to proceed given this confidence level]
2. [What would update your confidence]
3. [How to maintain appropriate humility while acting]

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Pyrrhonian Paralysis
**Pattern:** Excessive doubt preventing any action or belief
**Correction:** Remember that skepticism is for the study; practical life requires custom and belief

### Error 2: Dogmatic Overconfidence
**Pattern:** Claiming certainty about matters of fact
**Correction:** Only relations of ideas warrant certainty; matters of fact are always probable

### Error 3: All-or-Nothing Thinking
**Pattern:** Either complete certainty or complete doubt
**Correction:** Probability comes in degrees; calibrate to evidence

### Error 4: Ignoring Stakes
**Pattern:** Same doubt regardless of consequences
**Correction:** Higher stakes may warrant either more caution OR more willingness to act on probability

### Error 5: Misplaced Precision
**Pattern:** Claiming exact probabilities ("I'm 73% confident")
**Correction:** Rough calibration is more honest than false precision

---

## Constraints

- Do not advocate for extreme skepticism that prevents action
- Acknowledge that we must and do form beliefs to live
- Distinguish productive doubt from paralysis
- Remember custom/habit is how we navigate the world
- Skepticism should produce modesty and caution, not melancholy
- Be skeptical about your own skepticism

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've read several articles saying that intermittent fasting is the best diet for longevity. How confident should I be in this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Mitigated Skepticism Assessment: Intermittent Fasting and Longevity

### Belief Under Examination
**Claim:** Intermittent fasting is the best diet for longevity
**Current Confidence:** Implied moderate-to-high (based on "several articles")
**Stakes:** Health decisions, potentially significant life impact

### Classification

**Type:** Matter of Fact

**Certainty Possible:** NO

**Rationale:** This is an empirical claim about nutrition and health outcomes. The contrary is conceivable without contradiction—other diets might be equally or more effective. Even the best evidence would yield probability, not certainty.

### Evidence Assessment

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Uniformity | Weak | Studies show mixed results; effects vary by population, protocol, duration |
| Quantity | Limited | Long-term human studies on longevity are scarce; most evidence from animal models or short-term human trials |
| Quality | Medium | Some RCTs exist for weight loss; longevity claims extrapolated from proxy measures |
| Relevance | Indirect | "Longevity" requires decades of follow-up; current evidence uses surrogate markers |

**Overall Evidence Strength:** WEAK TO MODERATE

### Limits Acknowledged

**Epistemic Humility Points:**
- Longevity is decades-long outcome; no direct human evidence possible yet
- "Best diet" implies comparison to all alternatives—has this been tested?
- Individual variation may be large; what works for some may not work for others
- Publication bias may favor positive results
- Popular articles often overstate scientific findings

### Recommended Confidence

**Level:** LOW TO MODERATE

**Adjustment from Current:** LOWER (than "best diet" framing suggests)

**Rationale:**
"Intermittent fasting may have health benefits for some people based on preliminary evidence" is defensible. "Best diet for longevity" is much stronger than evidence supports. The claim:
1. Lacks long-term human longevity data
2. Requires ruling out all alternatives
3. Is presented as certain when highly uncertain
4. Relies heavily on animal studies and short-term proxies

### Practical Guidance

**Can You Act on This?** WITH CAUTION

**Recommendations:**
1. Try intermittent fasting if interested, but don't treat it as proven optimal
2. Monitor your own response; individual variation is real
3. Stay updated as evidence accumulates
4. Avoid "best" language; prefer "one promising approach among several"
5. Your diet choice should balance evidence, sustainability, and personal factors

## Integration

This skill is part of the **David Hume** expert persona. Use it to calibrate confidence on any belief. It pairs well with:
- **induction-audit** when the belief involves predictions
- **causation-examination** when the belief involves causal claims
- **is-ought-analysis** when the belief is used in moral arguments
